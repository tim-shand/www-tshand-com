## Greetings, I'm Tim ðŸ‘‹

An IT professional and avid tech enthusiast, with over a decade of industry experience.  

I enjoy designing and implementing automation solutions, configuring monitoring platforms, and working with code. Ultimately, my passion is solving problems and delivering solutions. Focusing my career ambitions towards Cloud platforms and DevOps has enabled me to utilize my personal interests as a skill set.  

It was MS-DOS where I found my love for computers. As a kid, my Dad would bring home old PCs from his workplace for me to mess about with. Countless system re-installs and upgrades soon followed.  

It's a real blessing when your hobby can also become your profession. 

My goal for this site, and future posts is to document my learning journey and personal projects.  
Hopefully it will also provide some value to others along the way.

## When I'm Not Doing Computer Stuff?

As a lover of the outdoors, I enjoy getting out and exploring remote places (both by 4WD and hiking).  
I'm also a keen skier, so the cold doesn't bother me, in fact I prefer it (accompanied by high altitude for bonus points). 

When I'm not tinkering with tech, I can be found working out in the shed.  
Fixing vehicles, restoring old motorbikes or building new garden beds.  

Feel free to reach out for chat, or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tshandnz).  

Cheers!
