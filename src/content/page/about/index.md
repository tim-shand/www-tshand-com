## Who am I?

An avid IT professional and enthusiast, currently working as a Systems Engineer with a local MSP. Â 

It was MS-DOS where I found my love for computers. As a kid, my Dad would bring home old PCs from his work for me to mess about with. Countless re-installs and upgrades soon followed.  

Now, with over a decade of experience in engineering and support roles, I have decided to focus my career ambitions towards DevOps, Cloud Platforms and development. This site, and future blog posts will serve as a way for me to document my learning journey, and hopefully provide some value for others along the way.  

I really enjoy working with automation, monitoring platforms, and getting stuck into some juicy code.  
It's a real blessing when your profession can also be your hobby.

## When I'm Not Doing IT Stuff?

I'm pretty keen on the outdoors, enjoy getting out and about, and exploring new places.  

The cold doesn't bother me, in fact I prefer it (accompanied by high altitude for bonus points).  
That being said, I also frequent the coast for a bit of fishing (although my catch-rate could do with some improvement).  

I'm also pretty handy on the tools, fixing up cars, old motorbikes and other general mechanical related repairs.
