## Who am I?

An avid IT professional and tech enthusiast, with over a decade of industry experience. Â 

I enjoy solving problems, implementing automation solutions, configuring monitoring platforms and working with code. Hence, I have decided to focus my career ambitions towards DevOps and Cloud Engineering. 

This site, and future blog posts will serve as a way for me to document my learning journey, hopefully providing some value to others along the way.  

It was MS-DOS where I found my love for computers. As a kid, my Dad would bring home old PCs from his work for me to mess about with. Countless re-installs and upgrades soon followed.  

It's a real blessing when your profession can also be your hobby.

## When I'm Not Doing IT Stuff?

I'm pretty keen on the outdoors and enjoy getting out and about, exploring remote places.  

The cold doesn't bother me, in fact I prefer it (accompanied by high altitude for bonus points).  
That being said, I also frequent the coast for a bit of fishing (although my catch-rate could do with some improvement).  

When I'm not tinkering with tech, I'm also pretty handy on the tools.  
Fixing up cars, restoring old motorbikes or building new garden beds.
