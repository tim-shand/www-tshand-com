## Greetings, I'm Tim ðŸ‘‹

An IT professional and avid tech enthusiast, with over a decade of industry experience.  

I enjoy designing and implementing automation solutions, configuring monitoring platforms, and working with code. 
Ultimately, my passion is solving problems and delivering real solutions. 
Focusing my career ambitions towards DevOps and Cloud Engineering has enabled me to utilize my personal interests as a skill set.  

It was MS-DOS where I found my love for computers.  
As a kid, my Dad would bring home old PCs from his work for me to mess about with. 
Countless system re-installs and upgrades soon followed.  
It's a real blessing when your hobby can also become your profession. 

My goal for this site, and future posts is document my learning journey and personal projects.  
Hopefully it will also provide some value to others along the way.

## When I'm Not Doing Conmputer Stuff?

I love the outdoors, enjoy getting out and exploring remote places (both by 4WD and hiking).  

As a keen skiier, the cold doesn't bother me, in fact I prefer it (accompanied by high altitude for bonus points).  
That being said, I also frequent the coast for a bit of fishing (although my catch-rate could do with some improvement).  

When I'm not tinkering with tech, I'm also pretty handy on the tools.  
Fixing/upgrading cars, restoring old motorbikes or building new garden beds.  

Feel free to reach out for chat, or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tshandnz).  

Cheers!
